MissionPossible is a simple app, built by Tom Minshull in Oct of 2015 under the mentorship of Michael Thompson. 

The point of the app was to gain experience setting up UITableViews, UICollectionViews, and gain some basic experience interacting with API's. 

I imported some external libraries using cocoapods to aid with the loading and caching web images, displaying progress huds to the user, and to implement pull to refresh on the UITableView.
